[The More Advanced Vehicles Project][mav] demonstrates vehicle simulation using
[the jMonkeyEngine (JME) game engine][jme]
and provides a library to support driving simulations.

It contains 4 sub-projects:

 1. MavLibrary: the MaVehicle library
 2. MavDemo1: a demo application with a Lemur-based GUI
 3. HelloMav: a very simple application using the MaVehicle library
 4. MavCommon: examples of vehicles, worlds, skies, etcetera

## How to download and run the MavDemo1 application

1. Install [Java], if you don't already have it.
2. Browse to https://github.com/stephengold/jme-vehicles/releases/tag/project-1.4.0
3. Follow the "MavDemo1.zip" link.
4. Save the ZIP file.
5. Extract the contents of the saved ZIP file.
  + using Bash:  `unzip MavDemo1.zip`
6. `cd` to the extracted "bin" directory/folder
  + using Bash:  `cd MavDemo1/bin`
7. Run the shell script.
  + using Bash:  `./MavDemo1`

The demo runs in a 1280x720 window.
After a brief loading animation,
the Main Menu appears in the upper-left corner of the window.

+ Navigate menus by clicking with the left mouse button (LMB).
+ If you have a wheel mouse, use the wheel to change the field of view.

## How to build and run More Advanced Vehicles from source

 1. Install a [Java Development Kit (JDK)][openJDK],
    if you don't already have one.
 2. Download and extract the More Advanced Vehicles source code from GitHub:
   + using Git:
     + `git clone https://github.com/stephengold/jme-vehicles.git`
     + `cd jme-vehicles`
     + `git checkout -b latest project-1.4.0`
   + using a web browser:
     + browse to https://github.com/stephengold/jme-vehicles/releases/tag/project-1.4.0
     + follow the "Source code (zip)" link
     + save the ZIP file
     + extract the contents of the saved ZIP file
     + `cd` to the extracted directory/folder
 3. Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable:
   + using Bash:  `export JAVA_HOME="` *path to your JDK* `"`
   + using Windows Command Prompt:  `set JAVA_HOME="` *path to your JDK* `"`
 4. Build the library and the applications:
   + using Bash:  `./gradlew build`
   + using Windows Command Prompt:  `.\gradlew build`

After a successful build,
Maven artifacts will be found in `MavLibrary/build/libs`.

## Controls

### In the MavDemo1 application

During the JmePower loading animation:

+ Pause : pause the animation
+ Tab : cancel the animation

General controls:

+ Numpad9 or wheel up : zoom in (narrow the field of view)
+ Numpad3 or wheel down : zoom out (widen the field of view)
+ Numpad6 : reset the field of view (to 90 degrees vertical angle)
+ "." or Pause : toggle the physics simulation paused/running
+ "/" : toggle physics debug visualization on/off
+ F12 : capture a screenshot to the current working directory
+ C : print details about the default `Camera` (viewpoint) to standard output
+ O : print details about the `BulletAppState` (physics) to standard output
+ P : print details about the `RenderManager` (graphics) to standard output

When the physics simulation is paused:

+ "," : single-step the physics simulation

When driving:

+ F5 : toggle viewpoints between dash camera and chase camera
+ Y : toggle the engine on/off
+ W : accelerate forward
+ S : apply the main brakes
+ Space : apply the parking brake
+ E : toggle the automatic transmission forward/reverse
+ A : steer left
+ D : steer right
+ H : sound the horn
+ R : reset the vehicle to a stable state
+ Esc : return to the Main Menu

Additional controls when the chase camera or orbit camera is active:

 + Numpad7 : dolly forward (toward the vehicle)
 + Numpad1 : dolly back (away from the vehicle)
 + Numpad8 or drag upward with MMB : orbit upward (to look down on the vehicle)

<a name="conventions"/>

## Conventions

Package names begin with `com.jayfella.jme.vehicle`

The source code is compatible with JDK 8.

The world (and physics-space) coordinate system is:

 + the `+X` axis points toward the northern horizon
 + the `+Y` axis points up (toward the zenith)
 + the `+Z` axis points toward the eastern horizon

The world (and physics-space) units of distance are *meters*.
